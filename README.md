# CommunistTelephone
A practical implementation of Communism; presented as an open-source card game that can be assembled in the span of about five minutes.


Inspired by this post by [nyancrimew](https://www.tumblr.com/nyancrimew/747102390430367744/real-communism-has-never-been-tried-before-have?source=share), I'm attempting an experiment to prove the point by offering up certain productive and useful

## Materials:
  - 1 Bic Pen
  - 1 Bic Lighter
  - 100 Index Cards
  - Hairbands

## Essentialisms:
I interpret nyancrimew's metaphor to represent the true necessity and purpose of capital and ownership.  They're both liquid, volumetric, resources distributed based on necessity while controlled strictly as a limitation of the mechanism through which it is distributed rather than an imposed _rule_ that the distribution be controlled.

We don't measure the volumetric capacity of a pen nor a lighter because of the slow-flow method of consuming the resource; you either really have to have something to say and can contribute to society et al by saying it, and the ability to do so is empowering.
